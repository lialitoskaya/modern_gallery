                  Stunning, breathtaking and very rare floor lamp by Tibor Hazi
                  1973. Talking about quality it doesn’t get much better. A real
                  contemporary space age design. Tibor Hazi a skilled glass
                  blower from Hungaria made this amazing floor lamp. The glass
                  was blown at the Tokod Glass Factory and due to the red color
                  it had to be send to Parad Glass Factory to be colored. Hazi
                  cut the glass himself and assembled the lights in his
                  workshop. The bases were bent by hand. The production of the
                  lights was quite time consuming and the result of it is
                  stunning.
